Customizations for Gary King's website.

Historically, Gary King's site was one of the first OpenScholar sites, and due
to Gary's close involvement and leadership in the OpenScholar project, Gary's
personal site became a test-bed for more experimental and fancy features.

This module provides a number of miscellaneous customizations:

* Alter gary's "people" page so no pager
* Allows nodes of type 'page' to not have titles if they are in the research-interest taxonomy
* Add checkbox on nodes in advanced options that allows him to use an alternate 'minimal' theme when viewing that node

These features forthcoming:

* "nodeorder" link on taxonomy terms using the the nodeorder module for taxonomy, disable for all other users
* Add the contextual annotation link functionality to his taxonomy terms from the port written by Jeffery
* Updates files when gary adds a new version to a dump directory
* Allow some term headings (configurable) to be hidden from anon users and show greyed out to logged in users
* Avoid custom taxonomy term list page, do use existing taxonomy theme functions
